# Naive Bayes Classifier on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
In this project, we have a Wisconsin breast cancer dataset reported by Dr. Wolberg that consists of 699 observations with 11 variables. The goal of this project is to create a Naive Bayes Classifier model to predict whether a cancer is malignant or benign from biopsy details.
